# scss-ideas
My idea is to make a function where splitting initial (default) design and developers implementation on the long run. This way, we preserve original design based on the mockups.  This is mobile first implementation, can reuse and replace selectors. NOTE: This is only a proposal and most developers care is changing css codes and admit it or not,  frequently forgetting fallback and cross browser compatibilities.
